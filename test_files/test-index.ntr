This file gets loaded first.
Put stuff like path aliases and common links here.

Directives start with `:`.

Aliases for paths. They go into env and can be used in your links along with any other env var.
If you do stuff like this, `ST_PKGS` needs to be set in your env.
:NOTR_PATH=$ST_PKGS/Notr
Note: use forward slash separator if compatibility with linux is important.

This means don't add this file to the index.
`:NO_INDEX`
