## Some basics

- Supported characters for a file name are letters, numbers, spaces, and `( ) _ - , .`
- File names should be limited to 100 characters.
- Characters that are NOT supported  `@ $ % & \ / : * ? " ' < > | ~ # ^ + = { } [ ] ; !`

_Italic stuff_

**Bold stuff**

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote. TODO1 seems to need a minimum of two markers.
>


> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.
> This line is part of the same quote.

Fancy:

> 25 years ago, but I didn't know how."

A code listing:
``` C
/** @brief Initialize the application */
int aggregator_init(aggregatorStruct* pAggregator)
{
    // Initialize state
    s_systemTimeMicroseconds = 0;
    s_systickFired = false;
    debugLog(DBG_LOG_ERR, "Error initializing the GPIO manager module");
}
```

Is this a definition list?
:   Looks like one to me
Is that right?
:   Possibly!

    Hey I'm a note. Don't mind me, I'm just sitting here.

## Links

Start with !.

??? Parse/open file links with something like open_context_url.py.

### URI
gogo http://casual-effects.com

[md link](https://casual-effects.com)

"http://casual-effects.com"


### Image or file >>>> use phantom?

![tux](https://www.markdownguide.org/assets/images/tux.png)


![fekix](felix.jpg)


### Internal links and sections ???

!"C:/Users/cepth/AppData/Roaming/Sublime%20Text/Packages/SublimeBagOfTricks/temp/file1.ntr.html#basicformatting"

<a href="file:///C:/Users/cepth/AppData/Roaming/Sublime%20Text/Packages/SublimeBagOfTricks/temp/file1.ntr.html#basicformatting">Basic formatting</a>


Section:

!Test

!DocId first_word_in_section_name_in_another_doc


Markdown does this:
- Any section header name followed by "section", "subsection", or "sec." will automatically be linked to that section.
- To link by number, use one of those key words followed by the section name (without the word section) in brackets.
- Reference-style links include arbitrary formatted text in brackets followed by a case-insensitive symbolic name that must be defined
elsewhere in the document:
  - Example using a symbolic name: [New York Times][nyt]
  - Example using the text as its own symbol: [Google][]
- Put the definitions at a convenient location elsewhere in the document:
  - [nyt]: http://nytimes.com
  - [google]: http://google.com

The mangling is URI encoding of the section name with spaces removed, in all lowercase.
For example, this section can be linked to as `features.md.html#links` or `features.md.html#basicformatting/links`.

*The easiest way to generate a link to a section is to simply
right-click (or ctrl-click) on that section header in the
browser. This will bring up a context menu that allows you to copy
either the internal Markdeep text of the link or the external HTML code link.*


# Unicode
UTF-8 encoding.

??? unicode menu/picker to insert, show at caret, ... probably a new module. see unicode.py.
